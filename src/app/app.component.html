    <h1>Career summary</h1>
    <p>I am a self taught web developer with an experience of 3 years. I started as a simple integrator and i'm now focused on working with the framework Angular.<br>
      I have 2 years of experience in Angular and i'm confident in my capability to develop organized and structured user interface using NgRx and Angular.<br>
      My main quality as a developer would be the organization and documentation I'm always doing when starting a project.<br>
      Driven by the desire to learn more and further complete my knowledge, I am used to pressure and tight deadlines, I develop even better under some stress.<br>
      Working with other developers and professional is a pleasure, I am pretty social and i'm sure I can fit in your team.
